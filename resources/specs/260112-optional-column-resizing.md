# Column Resizing (Optional - Food for Thought)

Currently Size and Date columns are fixed width. Research shows most file managers (Finder, Explorer, Path Finder, ForkLift) allow column resizing.

## Standard Behaviors

- **Manual resize**: Drag column dividers
- **Auto-fit**: Double-click divider to fit content
- **Persistence**: Save widths globally or per-folder
- **Name column**: Fills remaining space, other columns fixed or resizable

## Considerations

If implemented:
- Keep Name column flexible (fills space)
- Size and Date become draggable with minimum widths
- Double-click to auto-fit
- Persist widths in settings (global, not per-folder)
- Keyboard shortcut for auto-fit all (Cmd+Shift+R)

Low priority - current fixed layout works fine.
