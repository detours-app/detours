Generate a PNG with a white background, suitable for a macOS app icon. The image will be converted to .icns format at multiple resolutions from 16x16 to 512x512@2x, so it must remain recognizable at very small sizes.

Detours is a fast, keyboard-driven dual-pane file manager for macOS. It replaces Finder for developers and power users who value speed, keyboard efficiency, and clean design. Think Norton Commander meets modern macOS aesthetics. The defining visual of the app is two side-by-side file browsers. It's keyboard-first, emphasizing speed and instant navigation. This is a professional power-user tool, not a toy.

The icon should be modern, minimal, and geometric with clean lines and no unnecessary detail. It should feel confident and purposeful, like it belongs in a developer's dock next to Finder, Terminal, Xcode, Sublime Text, iTerm2, or Tower. Avoid overly literal file or folder depictions, skeuomorphic textures, busy compositions, cartoonish aesthetics, or generic speed imagery like lightning bolts.

The app uses a dark theme with teal accents. The signature accent color is a teal at hex 3D8A8A, used for selections, active states, and folder icons. The background is a dark neutral gray at 262626. Surfaces and panels use a slightly warmer dark at 242322. Borders and dividers are a subtle warm gray at 3D3A38. Primary text is an off-white at FAFAF8. The icon should prominently feature the teal 3D8A8A as its dominant or accent color, with the dark grays for contrast.

Consider these concept directions: Two geometric shapes side by side suggesting the split-view dual-pane layout, perhaps two rounded rectangles with a vertical divider. An abstract representation of navigation or forking paths that suggests "detours" as the name implies. A stylized keyboard key that incorporates the dual-pane concept. Or the letter D as a clean geometric form that incorporates the split or dual concept.

Output at least 1024x1024 pixels. Leave roughly ten percent margin from edges for the macOS rounded rectangle icon mask. The design must work within that rounded rectangle shape and remain clear and recognizable when scaled down to 16 pixels.
